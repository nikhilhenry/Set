# Set

A fully functional game of SET written in SwiftUI for iOS. Mid-term project for Stanford CS193p.

## Stack

- Data architecture using MVC
- Motion using SwiftUI animation library

## Features

## Thoughts

Architecting the app from scratch was particularly challening as there was no real road-map or implementation guidelines. The hints, however, did guide me through what I needed a head of implementing a particulary feature which helped me create a mental model of the implementation priority list. Animation took the longest to implement as I wasn't
well-wersed with the unique animation system of SwiftUI. The set matching alogrithm took many iterations to reach a fast, perfomant and functional state, but in the end I am extremely proud of the outcome I was able to achieve in 2 weeks after only having used Swift and SwiftUI for 2 weeks.
